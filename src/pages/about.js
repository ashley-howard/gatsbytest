                    <p>
                        I’m Ash, and I was born and raised in East London. I’ve been a web designer and developer for well over 10 years now,
                        striving to create refreshing and modern websites, while maintaining my own style; usually something simple or minimalistic.
                       </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then I've been challenging myself to create unique (and sometimes quirky) websites, ranging from dog-themed and photorealistic
                        designs to portfolios and conversion websites. I'm always enthusiastic to start new projects with new people, while keeping my mind
                        (and fingertips) busy.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        Being creative plays an important role in my life too, and I try to live every day as creatively as possible.
                        Music helps me a lot in the process, although I'm kinda stuck in the '90s... And when I'm trying to concentrate,
                        I go for lo-fi. I'm also passionate about technology (especially the latest gadgets), photography, and foreign languages.
                        </p>
